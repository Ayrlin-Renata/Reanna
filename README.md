 Inline calculation interface - do math in any text box.

## Operation
Type "--chelp " in a multi-line text box to view full help. 

In text mode, type "--c ", your expression, then "=". 

In window mode type "--c ", enter your expression, then click "OK".

Type "--ci " to toggle between these input modes, or "--cid " to display the current mode.

Type "--cdi " to choose whether or not the input text is erased when you enter your expression.

"--cdid " will display the current setting for the aforementioned setting. 

"--c --clk " will continuously evaluate your input until "--clk " is typed again, then once more.

"--u " enters unit conversion mode, even I don't know what that does. I wrote it like forever ago, i'll look at it later.


Using the arrow keys while entering an expression in text mode *WILL* mess it up and may delete stuff.


Previous answers can be expressed as 'ans' followed by a number, from 1 to about 9 quintillion.

For easy access to the windows calculator, you can type "--wcalc ". Type "--chelpf" for function help.
